# üí´ About Me:
üëã Hi! I'm Felipe Piacenza, but my friends call me Pipe or Pippen. I'm a 19-year-old systems student from Montevideo, Uruguay. My enthusiasm for technology and problem-solving drives me to constantly learn and explore new frontiers in the development world.

üîç Since I started my journey in programming, I have immersed myself in a variety of technologies and projects. I love tackling challenges and finding innovative solutions that not only solve problems but also enhance the user experience.

üöÄ Currently, I'm focused on an e-commerce project using JS, Node, Express, and PostgreSQL, among other technologies. My goal is to continue growing as a developer and contribute to different kinds of projects.

üí¨ I'm always open to new opportunities and collaborations. If you have an interesting idea or just want to chat about technology, feel free to contact me!

üåê You can follow my work and projects here on GitHub. Thanks for visiting my profile!
